Problem Description

You are given a binary array A of length N where each element is either 0 or 1.

Your task is to count the number of subarrays where the bitwise OR of all the elements in the subarray is 1.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 104
A[i] is either 0 or 1


Input Format

The First and the only argument is an Integer Array where each element is either 0 or 1.


Output Format

Return a single Integer representing the number of subarrays where the bitwise OR is 1


Example Input

Input 1:
A = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Input 2:
A = [0, 0, 0]


Example Output

Output 1:
11
Output 2:
0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
The only subarrays with OR = 1 are
[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [1], [1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]
Explanation 2:
There is no subarray, whose bitwise OR is 0.
