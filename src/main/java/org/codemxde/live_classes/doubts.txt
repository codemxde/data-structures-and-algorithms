Try to get these resolved in the doub solving session post the class:

1. N / 3 repeat number

URL: https://www.scaler.com/academy/mentee-dashboard/class/236044/homework/problems/67?navref=cl_tt_lst_nm

You're given a read-only array of N integers.
Find out if any integer occurs more than N/3 times in the array
in linear time and constant additional space.
If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.

If there are multiple solutions, return any one.

Note: Read-only array means that the input array should
not be modified in the process of solving the problem

MY ASK:
If it has to be performed in constant space, that means we can not use hashmap
then should a slding window be maintained which is just greater than N/3 ?
But still, even then how do we keep track of each numbers frequency without still needing a map
